# PUlogistic
Learning from positive and unlabelled data (PU learning) has attracted increasing interest within the machine learning literature as this type of data naturally arises in many applications (under reporting, text classification, disease gene identification). In the case of  PU data, we have an access to positive examples and unlabeled examples. Unlabeled examples can be either positive or negative. In this setting the true class label Y (0,1) is not observed directly. We only observe surrogate variable S, which indicates whether an example is labeled (and thus positive; S =1) or unlabeled (S=0).
In this project different strategies of fitting logistic regression for PU (Positive and Unlabelled) data are investigated.
We analysed 3 methods of fitting logistic regression for PU data: naive, weighted and joint method. 

See test.R file to learn how to use the methods.
